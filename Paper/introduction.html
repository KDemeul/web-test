				In this paper, a novel algorithm for curved needle segmentation in three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound images is presented. The algorithm is based on the projection of a filtered 3D image onto a two-dimensional (2D) image. Detection of the needle in the resulting 2D image determines a surface on which the needle is located. The needle is then segmented on the surface. The proposed technique is able to detect needles without any previous assumption about the needle shape, or any a priori knowledge about the needle insertion axis line.

				We present a method for automatic surgical tool localization in 3D ultrasound images based on line
				filtering, voxel classification and modelfitting. This could possibly provide assistance for biopsy needle ormicro-electrode nsertion, or a robotic system performing this insertion. The line-filtering method is first used to enhance the contrast of the 3D ltrasound image, then a classifier is chosen to separate the toolvoxels, in order to reduce the number of outliers. The last step is Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) model fitting. Experimental results on several different polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) cryogel data sets demonstrate that the failure rate of the method proposed here is improved by at least 86% compared to the model-fitting RANSAC algorithm with axis accuracy better than 1 mm, at the expense of only a modest increase in computational effort. The results of this experiment show that this system could be useful for clinical applications.

				In this paper, we present a method to localize and track manually inserted needles in real-time using a 3D ultrasound probe mounted on a robotized arm. The system tracks the needle using online image processing. We first propose a new algorithm capable of robustly detecting a needle from the moment it is inserted, without any a priori information on the insertion direction. By combining the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm with Kalman filtering in closed loop, we achieve robust real-time tracking of the needle. In addition, we propose a control scheme to automatically guide the ultrasonic probe in order to keep the needle within the field of view, while aligning its axis with the ultrasound beam. This method will ease the insertion of the needle by the operator, and allow the development of autonomous needle insertion by medical robots.

				<h4><a href="Needle/AdebarIROS2014.pdf" target="_blank">Recursive Estimation of Needle Pose for Control of 3D-Ultrasound-Guided Robotic Needle Steering</a></h4>

				Robotic systems can improve percutaneous interventions by steering flexible needles along nonlinear trajectories. These systems require medical image feedback for accurate closed-loop control. Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound can provide real-time measurements of needle pose within tissue; however, the ultrasound produces relatively large amounts of measurement noise. A recursive estimation approach is described for accurately estimating the six-degree-of-freedom pose of a steerable needle tip, by applying an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to 3D ultrasound segmentation results. The UKF is formulated based on a kinematic process model of needle steering, as well as experimental quantification of the statistical variability of steering and imaging needles in biological tissue. Validation testing shows that the UKF method makes accurate closed-loop robotic control of the needle tip possible in biological tissue. Compared to direct use of noisy ultrasound data for control feedback, the UKF reduced average positioning error by 9.58 mm (81%) when steering towards a simulated target. This new estimation scheme will contribute towards the future evaluation of needle steering robots in realworld clinical applications.

				<h4><a href="Needle/Barva-SPIEMI2005.pdf" target="_blank">Automatic Localization of Curvilinear Object in 3D Ultrasound Images</a></h4>

				Utilization of tools during surgical interventions sets the problem of their accurate localization within biological tissue. The ultrasound imaging represents an inexpensive and a flexible approach for a real-time image acquisition of tissue structure with metal instruments. There are several difficulties involving processing of ultrasound images: Their noisy nature makes the localization task difficult; the objects appear irregular and incomplete. Our task is to determine the position of a curvilinear electrode in biological tissue from a three-dimensional ultrasound image. Initially, the data are segmented by thresholding and processed with the randomized version of the RANSAC (R-RANSAC) algorithm. The curvilinear electrode is modeled by a three-dimensional cubic curve. Its shape is subject to check using a curvature measure in the hypothesis evaluation step of the R-RANSAC algorithm. Subsequently, we perform the least squares curve fitting to the data that have been marked by the R-RANSAC as the ones corresponding to the sought object. The position estimation is optimal with respect to the mean square criterion. Finally, the localization of the electrode tips is carried out by a hypothesis testing on the distances between projections of inliers on the estimated curve. The algorithm has been tested on real three- dimensional ultrasound images of a tissue mimicking phantom with a curvilinear object. From the results, we conclude that the method is very stable even if the data contain high percentage of outliers. The computational cost of the algorithm shows the possibility of real-time data processing

			<h4><a href="Needle/Barva-ieeeTUFFC2008.pdf" target="_blank"> Parallel Integral Projection Transform for Straight Electrode Localization in 3-D Ultrasound Images  </a></h4>
			<p>
				In surgical practice, small metallic instruments are frequently used to perform various tasks inside the human body. We address the problem of their accurate localization in the tissue. Recent experiments using medical ultrasound have shown that this modality is suitable for real-time visualization of anatomical structures as well as the position of surgical instruments. We propose an imageprocessing algorithm that permits automatic estimation of the position of a line-segment-shaped object. This method was applied to the localization of a thin metallic electrode in biological tissue. We show that the electrode axis can be found through maximizing the Parallel Integral Projection transform that is a form of the Radon transform. To accelerate this step, hierarchical mesh-grid algorithm is implemented. Once the axis position is known, localization of the electrode tip is performed. The method was tested on simulated images, on ultrasound images of a tissue mimicking phantom containing a metallic electrode, and on real ultrasound images from breast biopsy. The results indicate that the algorithm is robust with respect to variations in electrode position and speckle noise. Localization accuracy is of the order of hundreds of micrometers and is comparable to the ultrasound system axial resolution.

			<h4><a href="Needle/bohs2000spekle.pdf" target="_blank"> Speckle tracking for multi-dimensional flow estimation </a></h4>
			<p>
				Speckle tracking methods overcome the major limitations of current Doppler methods for flow imaging and quantification: angle dependence and aliasing. In this paper, we review the development of speckle tracking, with particular attention to the advantages and limitations of two-dimensional algorithms that use a single transducer aperture. Ensemble tracking, a recent speckle tracking method based upon parallel receive processing, is described. Experimental results with ensemble tracking indicate the ability to measure laminar flow in a phantom at a beam–vessel angle of 60°, which had not been possible with previous 2D speckle tracking methods. Finally, important areas for future research in speckle tracking are briefly summarized. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

			<h4><a href="Needle/cam08-65.pdf" target="_blank"> A novel method for enhanced needle localization using ultrasound-guidance </a></h4>
			<p>
				In this paper, we propose a novel and fast method to localize and track needles during image-guided interventions. Our proposed method is comprised of framework of needle detection and tracking in highly noisy ultrasound images via level set and PDE (partial differential equation) based methods. Major advantages of the method are: (1) efficiency, the entire numerical procedure can be finished in real-time: (2) robustness, insensitive to noise in the ultrasound images and: (3) flexibility, the motion of the needle can be as irregular as one wants. Our method will enhance the ability of medical care-providers to track and localize needles in relation to objects of interest during image-guided interventions.

			<h4><a href="Needle/doppler_basics.pdf" target="_blank"> Localization of Needle Tip with Color Doppler During Pericardiocentesis: In Vitro Validation and Initial Clinical Application  </a></h4>
			<p>
				This study evaluates a new device that uses color Doppler uitrasonography to enable real-time image guidance of the aspirating needle, which has not been possible until now. The ColorMark device (EchoCath Inc, Princeton, NJ) induces high-frequency, lowamplitude vibrations in the needle to enable localization with color Doppler. We studied this technique in 25 consecutive patients undergoing pericardiocentesis, and in vitro, in a urethane phantom with which the accuracy of color Doppler localization of the needle tip was compared with that obtained by direct measurement. Tip localization was excellent in vitro; errors axial to the ultrasound beam (velocity Doppler -0.13 + 0.90 ram; power Doppler -0.05 ± 1.7 ram) were less than lateral errors (velocity-O.36 ± 1.8 turn; power -0.02 + 2.8 ram). In 18 of 25 patients, the needle was identified and guided into the pericardial space with the ColorMark technique, and it allowed successful, uncomplicated drainage of fluid. Initial failures were the result of incorrect settings on the echocardiographic machine and inappropriate combinations of the needle puncture site and imaging window, This study demonstrates a novel color Doppler technique that is highly accurate at localizing a needle tip. The technique is feasible for guiding pericardiocentesis. Further clinical validation of this technique is required.

			<h4><a href="Needle/GreerMICCAI2014.pdf" target="_blank"> Real-Time 3D Curved Needle Segmentation Using Combined B-Mode and Power Doppler Ultrasound </a></h4>
			<p>
				This paper presents a real-time segmentation method for curved needles in biological tissue based on analysis of B-mode and power Doppler images from a tracked 2D ultrasound transducer. Mechanical vibration induced by an external voice coil results in a Doppler response along the needle shaft, which is centered around the needle section in the ultrasound image. First, B-mode image analysis is performed within regions of interest indicated by the Doppler response to create a segmentation of the needle section in the ultrasound image. Next, each needle section is decomposed into a sequence of points and transformed into a global coordinate system using the tracked transducer pose. Finally, the 3D shape is reconstructed from these points. The results of this method differ from manual segmentation by 0.71±0.55 mm in needle tip location and 0.38±0.27 mm along the needle shaft. This method is also fast, taking 5-10 ms to run on a standard PC, and is particularly advantageous in robotic needle steering, which involves thin, curved needles with poor echogenicity.

			<h4><a href="Needle/hal-00810785.pdf" target="_blank"> Tracking biopsy needle using Kalman filter and RANSAC algorithm with 3D ultrasound </a></h4>
			<p>
				Ultrasound navigation technology is used for medical examinations and minimally invasive surgeries. This paper presents an improved method for tracking micro tools as biopsy metallic needles insertion using 3D ultrasound. Previously, the RANSAC [1] algorithm has been implemented to detect the needle inserted in human tissue in a stationary situation. In this paper, the Kalman filter is added to increase the stability of the RANSAC algorithm and realize an application in a dynamic situation. The RANSAC algorithm is used to get the needle axis direction and the position of the needle tip. The speckle tracking method is used to estimate the inserting speed of the needle. The Kalman filter uses the results given by the two methods above as the measurement to make the estimation of the direction of the needle and the position of the needle tip. The simulated results show that in both stationary and dynamic situations, the proposed method gives a more stable and accurate result than the RANSAC algorithm.

			<h4><a href="Needle/hatt_beamsteering.pdf" target="_blank"> Enhanced needle localization in ultrasound using beam steering and learning-based segmentation </a></h4>
			<p>
				Segmentation of needles in ultrasound images remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we introduce a machine learning-based method for needle segmentation in 2D beam-steered ultrasound images. We used a statistical boosting approach to train a pixel-wise classifier for needle segmentation. The Radon transform was then used to find the needle position and orientation from the segmented image. We validated our method with data from ex vivo specimens and clinical nerve block procedures, and compared the results to those obtained using previously reported needle segmentation methods. Results show improved localization success and accuracy using the proposed method. For the ex vivo datasets, assuming that the needle orientation was known a priori, the needle was successfully localized in 86.2% of the images, with a mean targeting error of 0.48 mm. The robustness of the proposed method to a lack of a priori knowledge of needle orientation was also demonstrated. For the clinical datasets, assuming that the needle orientation was closely aligned with the beam steering angle selected by the physician, the needle was successfully localized in 99.8% of the images, with a mean targeting error 0.19 mm. These results indicate thatthe learning-based segmentation method may allow for increased targeting accuracy and enhanced visualization during ultrasound-guided needle procedures.

			<h4><a href="Needle/LuMICCAI2014.pdf" target="_blank"> A New Sensor Technology for 2D Ultrasound-Guided Needle Tracking </a></h4>
			<p>
				2D Ultrasound (US) is becoming the preferred modality for image-guided interventions due to its low cost and portability. However, the main limitation is the limited visibility of surgical tools. We present a new sensor technology that can easily be embedded on needles that are used for US-guided interventions. Two different types of materials are proposed to be used as sensor - co-polymer and PZT. The co-polymer technology is particularly attractive due to its plasticity, allowing very thin depositions (10-20 µm) on a variety of needle shapes. Both sensors receive acoustic energy and convert it to an electrical signal. The precise location of the needle can then be estimated from this signal, to provide real-time feedback to the clinician. We evaluated the feasibility of this new technology using (i) a 4DOF robot in a water tank; (ii) extensive ex vivo experiments; and (iii) in vivo studies. Quantitative robotic studies indicated that the co-polymer is more robust and stable when compared to PZT. In quantitative experiments, the technology achieved a tracking accuracy of 0.14 ± 0.03mm, significantly superior to competing technologies. The technology also proved success in near-real clinical studies on tissue data. This sensor technology is non-disruptive of existing clinical workflows, highly accurate, and is cost-effective. Initial clinician feedback shows great potential for large scale clinical impact.

			<h4><a href="Needle/MRPIP.pdf" target="_blank"> Multi-resolution parallel integral projection for fast localization of a straight electrode in 3d ultrasound images </a></h4>
			<p>
				We address the problem of fast and accurate localization of miniature surgical instruments like needles or electrodes using 3D ultrasound (US). An algorithm based on maximizing a Parallel Integral Transform (PIP) can automatically localize line-shaped objects in 3D US images with accuracy on the order of hundreds of micrometers. Here we propose to use a multi-resolution to accelerate the algorithm signiſcantly. We use a maximum function for downsampling to preserve the high intensity voxels of a thin electrode. We integrate the multi-resolution pyramid into a hierarchical mesh-grid search of PIP. The experiments with a tissue mimicking phantom and breast biopsy data show that proposed method works well on real US images. The speed-up is threefold compared to original PIP method with the same accuracy 0.4 mm. A further speed-up up to 16 times is reached by an early stopping of the optimization, at the expense of some loss of accuracy.

			<h4><a href="Needle/Okazawa2006330.pdf" target="_blank"> Methods for segmenting curved needles in ultrasound images </a></h4>
			<p>
				Ultrasound-guided percutaneous needle insertions are widely used techniques in current clinical practice. Some of these procedures have a high degree of difficulty because of poor observability of the needle in the ultrasound image. There have been recent efforts t improve g idance by computer assisted needle detection. These software techniques are often limited by not representing need e curvature We presen  two methods to detect the needle in 2D ultrasound that specifically address needle curvature. Firstly, we demonstrate a real-time needle segmentation algorithm based on the Hough transform which detects the needle and represents its curved shape. Secondly we demonstrate how a new coordinate transformation can transform detection of a curved needle to a linear fit. These methods are demonstrated on ultrasound and photographic images.

			<h4><a href="Needle/Uhercik2009ICU.pdf" target="_blank"> Needle localization methods in 3D ultrasound data </a></h4>
			<p>
				Ultrasound imaging has shown to be well adapted for guidance of micro tools, such as biopsy needles or electrodes, in the human body. Indeed it is safe for both patient and physicians, it is cheap and flexible compared to other imaging modalities. The ultrasound imaging offers a real-time acquisition speed but it has to deal with a typical speckle noise and other acoustic artifacts in the image. In clinical practice the tool in ultrasound image is identified by a human expert. This paper gives an overview of automatic localization methods for needles or electrodes in 3D ultrasound data. We have developed two methods for axis localization: the 1 st method is based on Parallel Integral Projection for localization of a straight tool; the 2 nd method for axis localization of a curvilinear tool is based on model fitting using a RANSAC algorithm for robust and fast estimation. We present results on phantom data and breast biopsy data.

			<h4><a href="Needle/US_review.pdf" target="_blank"> Ultrasound Imaging and Image Segmentation in the area of Ultrasound: A Review  </a></h4>
			<p>
				Segmentation remains a necessary step in medical imaging to obtain qualitative measurements such as the location of objects of interest as well as for quantitative measurements such as area, volume or the analysis of dynamic behavior of anatomical structures over time. Among these images, ultrasound images play a crucial role, because they can be produced at video-rate and therefore allow a dynamic analysis of moving structures. Moreover, the acquisition of these images is non-invasive, cheap, and does not require ionizing radiations compared to other medical imaging techniques. On the other hand, the automatic segmentation of anatomical structures in ultrasound imagery is a real challenge due to acoustic interferences (speckle noise) and artifacts which are inherent in these images. Here we discuss the ultrasound image segmentation methods, in a broad sense, focusing on techniques developed for medical. First, we present basic methods of image segmentation and forming of ultrasound images. After that we discuss the basics on ultrasound image segmentation. Second section explains the ultrasonic image segmentation methods based on clinical applications. On the other hand Third section explains the ultrasound image segmentation based on particular methodology

			<h4><a href="Needle/zhao2013automatic.pdf" target="_blank"> Automatic Needle Detection and Tracking in 3D Ultrasound Using an ROI-Based RANSAC and Kalman Method </a></h4>
			<p>
				This article proposes a robust technique for needle detection and tracking using threedimensional ultrasound (3D US). It is difficult for radiologists to detect and follow the position of micro tools, such as biopsy needles, that are inserted in human tissues under 3D US guidance. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a method that automatically reduces the processed volume to a limited region of interest (ROI), increasing at the same time the calculation speed and the robustness of the proposed technique. First, a line filter method that enhances the contrast of the needle against the background is used to facilitate the initialization of ROI using the tubularness information of the complete US volume. Then, the random sample consensus (RANSAC) and Kalman filter (RK) algorithm is used in the ROI to detect and track the precise position of the needle. A series of numerical inhomogeneous phantoms with a needle simulated from real 3D US volumes are used to evaluate our method. The results show that the proposed method is much more robust than the RANSAC algorithm when detecting the needle, regardless of whether or not the insertion axis corresponds to an acquisition plane in the 3D US volume. The possibility of failure is also discussed in this article.
