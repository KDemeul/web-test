<h4>Motivation </h4>
<p>
	Tools such as metallic electrodes, injection needles and miniature tips that serves for sampling tissue cells, introducing fluids to body, measuring cell activites are routinely employed. 
	In order to acess deeper structure, practicians traditionally relied on surface marking to guide the needle into the correct position. 
</p>
<p>
	One common intervention is brachytherapy in which a radiation source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment. It is commonly used as an effective treatment for cervical, prostate, breast, and skin cancer. 
	Another example is the ultrasound-guided breast biopsy which is performed to remove some cells and examine them under a microscope to determine a diagnosis.
</p>
<p>
	In those interventions, needle misplacement has the potiential to damage structures like arteries, nerve bundles and pleura. 
	Qualitative measurements of the location of objects in medical images is a key to improve the quality of such procedures. 
</p>
<p>
	In this context, ultrasound images  guidance offers several advantages including a greater likelihood of sucess, better visualization of the target and they are produce at video-rate allowing either real-time analysis by the practician or automatic steering. Lastly, the purchase and operational cost are relatively modest (compared to other medical modalities) and the compactness of the probes facilitates the integration in the practician workspace.   
</p>

<h4> Technical background </h4>
<p>
	Medical ultrasound permits to view internal body structures including tendons, muscles, joints, vessels and internal organs by exploiting the backscattering of energy in the boundaries between tissues.
	Numbers of sound waves are typically formed by a piezoelectric transducer and are transmitted to the body along pre-determined trajectories, each of them forming a narrow ultrasound beam. 
	The return of the sound wave vibrates the transducer which turns the vibrations into electrical pulses which are processed and transformed into a digital image.
	Typically, the waves frequencies used in medical practice are in the range from 1 to 20 MHz and the image acquisition rate (frame rate) is usually in the range from 5 to 80 frames per second \ref{Barva-TR-2007-12}.
</p>
<p> 
	However, object detection in ultrasound images is made difficult by the following issues.

<h4>State of the art</h4>

<p> 
	Many technique have been developped to achieve needle localization in ultrasound images. In this section, we summarize the principle of each technique and discuss experimental results in terms of localization accuracy. Needle localization can be seen has a two step process: localization of the needle axis (a line inside the US image) and the localization of its tip (a point inside the US image).
</p>
	RANSAC (<b>RA</b>ndom <b>SA</b>mple <b>C</b>onsensus) algorithm is by far the most used technique for axis localization. It is an iterative method to estimate parameters of a mathematical model from a set of observed data which contains outliers. 

	It is a non-deterministic algorithm in the sense that it produces a reasonable result only with a certain probability, with this probability increasing as more iterations are allowed. The algorithm was first published by Fischler and Bolles in 1981 \ref{Fischler1981} and has been used widely in signal and image processing.

	It is frequently use in axis localization because of its few assumptions about the data (direction, bending) and its good results \ref{Uher-13, Chatelain13a, BARV-05b, Zhao-12b, UHER-09a, zhao2013automatic}. The main principle of the aglorithm is develop in Chapter \ref{axis}.
