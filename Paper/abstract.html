		<p>
			Many medical interventions involves ultrasound based imaging systems to safely localize and navigate instruments into the patient body. 
			To facilitate visual tracking of the instruments, we investigate the techniques and methodologies best suited for solving the problem of needle localization in ultrasound images and propose our own approach to tackle the problem. 
		</p>
		<p>
			We present a robust prodedure that automatically determine the position of a needle in a 2D ultrasound images. 
			Such a task is decomposed into the localization of the needle axis and its tip. 
			A first estimation of the axis position is computed with the help of multiple position sensors, including one embedded in the transducer and another in the needle. 
			Based on this, the needle axis is computed using a RANSAC algorithm and a KALMAN filter to compensate measurement incertainties. The tip is detected by analyzing the intensity along the axis.
		</p>
		<p>
			The algorithms were experimentally verified on real ultrasound images acquired by a 2D scanner scanning a portion of a cryogel phantom that contained a thin metallic needle. 
			The experiments shows that the algorithms are capable of detecting a needle with the accuracy of %TODO% mm.
			The computational time of the order of millisecond permits real time needle localization.
