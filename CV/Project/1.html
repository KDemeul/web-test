<p>Real Time Strategy games (RTS) present a complete simulated environment that pose many interesting challenges to the research of Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>Among these challenges are the huge branching factor of play and constrained time for making decisions.<p>
<p>In this project, in a team of 2,  we tackle the problem of the management of combat units at a micro-level, that is: given a scenario with for example 10 vs. 10 units that are about to engage in battle, which actions should our units perform?</p>
<p>We created a detailed model for the simulation of such battles, together with two different searching algorithms making use of the model, Alpha-Beta and UCT</p>
<p>Then, we implemented this searching algorithms along with some scripted behaviors inside the game Stacraft: Broodwar, using the Broodwar API (BWAPI) for interfacing with the game</p>

<p> The following algorithm have been implemented:
<ul class="list-unstyled">
	<li><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> Each unit attack the closest opponent </li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> All units focus their fire on one unit </li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> Kitting behavior (Attack then flee away)</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> Alpha-Beta search</span></li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> UCT Search (Monte Carlo Algorithm)</li>
</ul>
