<p>The purpose of this project was to create an environment - using Unity 3D - where vehicules execute cooperativly search and pursuit of intruders.</p>
<p>The problem involves optimising different algorithms such as discretizing an environment, computing a minimal path for a fleet of vehicule that are to survey a given area, optimizing the search of a mobile intruder, pursuiting and capturing an intruder.</p>
<p>In this project we focused on three different problems:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled">
	<li><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> How to find the position of static guards such that a given set of building is completly guard.</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> How to clean a area with moving guard - <i>i.e.</i> every part of the area has been seen.</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> How to search and capture a moving intruder that is trying to escape.</li>
</ul>
