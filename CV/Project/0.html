<p>In a team of 5, we designed a robot that could find its way into a house (the maze), detect, localize and identify the different objects in the house.</p>
<p>During phase 1, the robot should explore the whole house and build a map of its environment (including object positions and identities).</p> 
<p>During phase 2, it is supposed to fetch the previously identified objects.</p> 
<p>Our solution relies on four different parts:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled">
	<li><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> Motion controller
	<li><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm
	<li><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> Local trajectory controller and global path finder
	<li><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> Detection and identification of objects "on the go"
</ul>
